  "enough tools for getting started with planning a hiking trip. It is not " +
  "an attempt to replace existing trail websites and guides; but to " +
  "complement them. This site should be used as a first step for finding a " +
  "suitable trail, then users go on to more in-depth information " +
  "resources. It is made with visitors to Sweden in mind, but hopefully " +
  "Swedish nationals will find it useful too."
  const infoSecond =
  "Many more trails will be added to the list and information will be edited. " +
  "The maps will show more accurate routes of the trails (and not just a line " +
  "between start and finish), and a search function will be added to each " +
  "trail description to let users search for public transport routes and " +
  "timetables."
