# Hiking Trails in Sweden

Built with React this site helps you find a Swedish hiking trail based on your preferences.

This project is work in progress and just got started. The aim is to provide an overview of all major hiking trails in Sweden and enough tools for getting started with planning a hiking trip. It is not an attempt to replace existing trail websites and guides; but to complement them. The project should be used as a first step for finding a suitable trail, then users go on to other more in-depth information resources. It is made with visitors to Sweden in mind, but hopefully Swedish nationals will find it useful too.

Many more trails will be added to the list and current information is likely to be edited. The plan is that the maps will show more accurate routes of the trails (and not just a line between start and finish), and a search function will be added to each trail description to let users search for public transport routes and timetables.
